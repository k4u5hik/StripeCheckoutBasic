# StripeCheckoutBasic

I am quite please with myself because this is the first time that I have been able to actually program the frontend and the backend to work together with a payments processor. This opens up many ways I can monetise with my website design and not have to pay for the ecommerce website provision. I understand that it comes with a risk but it is great for a starter like myself who is working on low volumes and many different websites.

# Online Store checkout with Stripe - Repl-it

- Check and update the YOUR_DOMAIN of the hosted frontend and backend.
- Check and update the .env in the backend directory
- `npm install` (installs stripe, express and cors)
- Stop the server side
